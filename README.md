# Nurse Wage Calculator

Created a wage calculator that takes into account differentials for nursing hourly wages. You can put in all the dates and times for your work week and it will spit out how much you will make pre-tax. Will automatically compensate for differentials when calculating overtime.

### TODO:
- fix having to press the delete button twice in order to actually remove a work period
- add in option to convert differentials to dollar values rather than percentages to account for different ways of calculating differential pay
- show pay post-tax and pre-tax
- one thing I want to add is the ability to input an entire pay period (about a month) so if you plan out your shifts in advance, you can budget with an estimate for your total earnings
